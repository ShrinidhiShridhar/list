    <h1>BOOTSTRAP</h1>
    <dd>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used for designing responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. Originally developed by Twitter, Bootstrap provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, modals, and carousels. It follows a grid-based layout system, which makes it easy to create structured and flexible page layouts. Bootstrap ensures that websites look consistent and function well across different devices and browsers. Its simplicity, extensive documentation, and ready-to-use design elements make it a favorite choice for developers aiming to build modern, user-friendly interfaces quickly.</dd><br>
