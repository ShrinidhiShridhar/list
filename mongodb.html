    <h1>MONGODB</h1>
    <dd>MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases, it does not require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic and hierarchical data structures. MongoDB is designed for high performance, scalability, and ease of development, making it ideal for modern applications that handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It supports powerful querying, indexing, and aggregation features, and is commonly used in web applications, real-time analytics, and big data solutions.</dd>
