    <h1>JAVA</h1>
    <dd>ava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning code written in Java can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java a popular choice for building cross-platform applications. Java is widely used for developing web applications, desktop software, mobile apps (especially Android), and enterprise-level systems. It features strong memory management, built-in security, multithreading support, and a rich standard library, making it a robust and versatile language for developers.</dd><br>
