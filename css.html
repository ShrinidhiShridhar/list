    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and design of HTML documents. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of web pages. By separating content (HTML) from style (CSS), it allows developers to maintain and update the look of a website more efficiently. CSS supports responsive design, enabling websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It includes features like selectors, classes, IDs, media queries, and animations, making it a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces.</dd><br>
