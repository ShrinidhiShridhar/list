    <h1>NodeJS</h1>
    <dd>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome, Node.js enables fast and scalable network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, particularly suitable for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js supports thousands of packages through its npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem, making it easier for developers to build web servers, APIs, and full-stack applications. Its ability to use JavaScript both on the client and server side has made it a popular choice among developers for building modern web applications.</dd><br>
