    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <dd>Spring is a powerful, lightweight, and open-source Java framework used to build enterprise-level applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications by promoting good design practices like dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). The core Spring framework focuses on enabling loose coupling between components, and its ecosystem includes modules like Spring MVC for web development, Spring Boot for rapid application setup, and Spring Data for simplified data access. Spring helps developers build scalable, maintainable, and secure applications efficiently.</dd><br>
