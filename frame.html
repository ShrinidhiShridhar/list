    <h1>FrameWork</h1>
    <dd>A framework in software development is a reusable, pre-built structure or set of tools that provides a foundation for building applications. It offers a standardized way to develop and deploy software by including common functionalities such as routing, database access, templating, and session management. Frameworks help developers save time by eliminating the need to write repetitive code and ensure consistency and scalability in applications. They often enforce design patterns and best practices, making the code more organized and maintainable. Examples include Django for Python, Spring for Java, and Angular for JavaScript.</dd><br>
