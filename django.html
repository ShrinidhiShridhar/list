    <h1>Django</h1>
    <dd>Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern and encourages clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so developers can focus on writing their applications without needing to reinvent the wheel. It includes a built-in admin interface, robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, and support for tasks like authentication, routing, form handling, and security features like CSRF protection. Django is widely used for building everything from simple websites to complex, data-driven web applications.</dd><br>
