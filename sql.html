    <h1>SQL</h1>
    <dd>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations) using simple and declarative commands. SQL is essential for defining database structures (schemas), querying data, joining tables, filtering results, and managing permissions. It is widely used in applications that rely on structured data, and supported by database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</dd><br>
