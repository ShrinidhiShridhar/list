    <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <dd>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript runs directly in the web browser, enabling features such as real-time updates, animations, form validations, and interactive user interfaces. It supports event-driven, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. With the rise of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has become essential for building complex single-page applications (SPAs). Additionally, with environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, making it a full-stack language.</dd><br>
